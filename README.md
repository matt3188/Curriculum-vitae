##TODO
- Look into TDD or BDD tests
- Create elements with javascript and test to see if they are present before passing CI
- Find a way to specify the list element (if) needed for a particular section and specify class names needed
- Intergrate sendgrid with contact form and test
- Make var app = {} a seperate file
- Update PDF CV to link to site
- Modualise Javascript. Move all sections (Portfolio, Experience, etc.) into their own files that can all be fired by app.
- Remove jQuery dependency
